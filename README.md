# Hi, I'm Swastik 👋

🎓 Computer Science undergraduate  
🔐 Cybersecurity & Systems focused  
🏫 Central University of Jammu

I am interested in understanding system-level security, attacker behavior, and defensive mechanisms. My focus is on fundamentals such as operating systems, networks, and secure system design, with hands-on work in cyber deception and attack analysis.
